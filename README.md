# pendingfcpayouts
Simple script to check pending/request payouts 

Currently being updated/fixed to work without the use of external cookie generation, all automated.
You can run the code using fetched browser cookies manually and they don't expire for a while
The code manages payouts showing `requested` status only
working on making it multi option to show
1 item sales
> total sales over a span of time or all time
> total  payouts as well over a span of time or all time
